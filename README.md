## 🧠 About

This repository includes Java solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems, spanning different categories and difficulty levels (Easy / Medium / Hard). Each file represents a standalone solution for a particular problem.

These solutions are ideal for:
- Practicing data structures & algorithms.
- Preparing for coding interviews.
- Comparing approaches and understanding Java implementations.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Most developers use LeetCode to sharpen their coding and algorithm skills before interviews. This repo aims to:

- Provide clean, understandable Java implementations.
- Group similar problems for better study flow.
- Serve as a reference for common coding patterns and techniques.
